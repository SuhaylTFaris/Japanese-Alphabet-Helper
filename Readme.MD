# Front-end Project Proposal

I will be working on an app that will teach you how to write, read, understand and word out Japanese hiragana and maybe katakana letters.

## This project will include:

### Interactivity

Will use DOM and JQuery to allow users to get additional info on each letter when they click. This will include:

  - Visual and Sound based (sound files called with JQuery) memory helpers.

  - Tips and fun facts on each letter.

  - Stretch : Add how to write each letter.

  - A swap box to switch between each set of letters... Vowels dropdown, then "B" would show all "letters" starting with "B". ex. "Ba", "Bi", "Bu", "Be" and "Bo".

  - Stretch : Add Katakana, teach how to use extended vowels "-" and the use of "small TSU" that extends consonants. "small TSU" + "ta" equals "tta" in cases such as "Yatta!" which means "Hurray!".
